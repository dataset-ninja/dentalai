**Dentalai Computer Vision Project** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 2495 images with 28904 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *tooth*, *caries*, *cavity*, and other: *crack*.

Images in the Dentalai dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1991 images), *valid* (254 images), and *test* (250 images). The dataset was released in 2023.
